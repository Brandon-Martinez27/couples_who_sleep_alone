# Couples Who Sleep Alone

## About the Project


### Goals
- Find what factors influence a couple to sleep in separate beds
- Build a classification model to predict whether a couple will sleep in separate beds
- Explore the possiblity of marketing separate beds to couple's that tend to sleep separately

### Background
>In 1927, the Motion Picture Association of America issued “The Don’ts and Be Carefuls.” Item No. 19 in the “be careful” section of the list was “man and woman in bed together” — a scene the organization thought could risk “vulgarity and suggestiveness.” Even decades later on TV, Lucy and Ricky were always shown in separate beds in “I Love Lucy” despite being married offscreen, as well as on it.

>Times have changed. It doesn’t take a data journalist to work out that the chances of you having seen a couple sharing a bed onscreen is high. But the reality of what’s happening offscreen is harder to gauge, tucked away in bedrooms. After all, Anonymous, how many people have you told about your sleeping arrangements?

## Initial Thoughts & Hypotheses
### Thoughts
First ideas about project while initially exploring the dataset.

### Hypotheses
A hypotheses that you test in your project. Feature x significantly increases with feature y.
```
Null hypothesis: Feature x does not correlate with feature y.
Alternative hypothesis: Feature x has a significant correlation with feature y.
```

A second hypotheses that you test in your project. Feature x significantly increases with feature y.
```
Null hypothesis: Feature x does not correlate with feature y.
Alternative hypothesis: Feature x has a significant correlation with feature y.
```
